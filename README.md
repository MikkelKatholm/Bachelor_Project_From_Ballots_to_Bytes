# Bachelor Project in Computer Science

## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the Bachelor Project in Computer Science at Aarhus University. The main focus of the project was to understand and study how secret sharing and homomorphic encryption can be used for secure multi-party computation, more specifically for electronic voting. The project was divided into two parts, the first part focused on secret sharing and the second part focused on homomorphic encryption. For more information about the project, please refer to the report `From Ballots to Bytes - Voting Electronically with Secret Sharing & Homomorphic Encryption.pdf`.
